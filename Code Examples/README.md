# Examples of NPynn
**Attention: These examples are from the older version of NPynn, and so some of the function names will appear different**

In this section fo the repository there are different examples of using NPynn. Since this framework can perform both regression and classification, there are examples for both.
For classificaton, I have used:
 - FashionMNIST dataset
 - MNIST Dataset
